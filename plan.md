# Security Hardening Plan

## Task 1: Add Input Validation & Rate Limiting ✅ COMPLETED
- Implement request validation schema for API endpoints
- Add rate limiting to prevent DoS attacks
- Validate all incoming request parameters

## Task 2: Add Security Headers ✅ COMPLETED
- Configure helmet or fastify-helmet for security headers
- Set CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options, etc.
- Disable X-Powered-By header

## Task 3: Error Handling & Information Disclosure ✅ COMPLETED
- Implemented custom error handler that hides stack traces in production
- Validation errors return 400 with structured response (no sensitive info)
- Generic errors return 500 without exposing details in production
- All errors logged with structured logging (headers redacted)

## Task 4: Environment Configuration Hardening ✅ COMPLETED
- Created .env.example with all configurable options
- Added config validation module (src/config.js)
- Server validates required env vars on startup (fail fast)
- Supports NODE_ENV, PORT, HOST, RATE_LIMIT_MAX, RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW, CORS_ORIGINS

## Task 5: Request Logging & Monitoring ✅ COMPLETED
- Implemented structured request logging (method, url, status, response time)
- Sensitive headers (authorization, cookies, api keys) are automatically redacted
- Rate limit hits logged as warnings
- Validation errors logged with error details
- All logging uses structured format for easy parsing

## Task 6: CORS Configuration ✅ COMPLETED
- Added @fastify/cors with explicit origin whitelist from env (CORS_ORIGINS)
- Only allows GET and POST methods
- Explicit headers: content-type, authorization
- Credentials enabled for authenticated requests
- Blocks requests from non-whitelisted origins

## Task 7: Graceful Shutdown & Health Checks ✅ COMPLETED
- SIGTERM/SIGINT handlers for graceful shutdown
- Three health endpoints:
  - /health - main readiness check (503 during shutdown)
  - /health/live - liveness probe (always 200)
  - /health/ready - readiness probe (503 during shutdown)
- Server refuses new requests during shutdown
- All tests pass (38 tests across 9 test files)
